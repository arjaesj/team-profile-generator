  ![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-ISC-green.svg)

## Description
This is a Node CLI (command line interface) that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person based on the inputs you provided for each prompt after running the `node app.js` file. Now you can view your whole team's profile in a more pleasing way and easily take you to their github account, if applicable, or can easily send an email to them.
